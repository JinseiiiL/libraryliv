# Library System API

The PHP-based RESTful API enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing books and authors within a library system. Built using the Slim Framework, it adheres to standard RESTful principles, ensuring compatibility with various client applications. The API incorporates JWT-based authentication to secure access to its endpoints, allowing only authorized users to manage the library's catalog of books and authors.

# API Features
##### Secure Token-Based Authentication: 
Each request is authenticated with a JSON Web Token (JWT), ensuring only authorized users can perform operations. Tokens are validated with each request and refreshed as necessary for session continuity.

##### User Registration and Authentication: 
Allows users to register and log in securely. Each request is authenticated with a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is validated with each request and refreshed as needed to maintain session continuity.

##### CRUD Operations for Authors: 
- ###### Create Author: 
    Adds a new author to the database.
- ###### Read Authors:
    Retrieves a list of all authors.
- ###### Update Author:
    Allows modification of an authorâ€™s name.
- ###### Delete Author: 
    Removes an author, first deleting any associated books to maintain referential integrity.
 

##### CRUD Operations for Books: 
- ###### Create Book:
    Adds a new book to the database, checking for duplicate titles by the same author.
- ###### Read Books:
    Retrieves the list of all books in the database.
- ###### Update Book: 
    Modifies the title of an existing book, with validations to prevent duplicate entries by the same author.
- ###### Delete Book: 
    Removes a book from the database, first deleting any references to maintain referential integrity.

###### Retrieve Authors and Their Books: 
This endpoint lists all authors in the database along with the titles of their books, providing a structured response suitable for both displaying and filtering books by author.

##### These API implements security and reliability measures, including:
- Tokens are refreshed with each request.
- Detailed error messages are returned in case of database errors or validation failures.
- Careful handling of related entries (e.g., books and authors) ensures that deletions maintain database integrity by clearing linked references before proceeding.
